Some points to keep in mind while solving questions on data
structures and algorithms

1. Write clean and efficient code with proper type checking
of arguments like we saw in our previous videos.

2. Names of variables should be descriptive. Your code is
to be read by humans so it should speak for itself and
should be self-explanatory.

3. Feel free to implement in any language you want
it is the logic that matters and not the language.
Problem Solving is an art :)
